<h1>DigSig-ng - ELF signature verification in the Linux 3.x kernel</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>DigSig-ng is a Linux kernel security module, providing runtime support for RSA digital signature verification of ELF executables and dynamic libraries. It is intended to increase system security by only allowing trusted ELF executables and libraries to run.</p>
<p>DigSig-ng is a fork of the DigSig project, which began in 2003 as part of a research project by Ericsson Research Canada (Open Systems Lab), but has been unmaintained since March 5th 2009, with the last major release on January 29th 2008.</p>
<p>DigSig-ng aims to maintain the DigSig project, but also to improve the original project in several ways. DigSig-ng's future roadmap aims to provide support for newer, more secure cryptographic hash functions (i.e. SHA-2 and SHA-3), support for RSA key lengths above 2048 bits, support for elliptic-curve (ECDSA) signing and verification and the ability to stack DigSig with other kernel security modules.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>DigSig-ng is <b>pre-release software</b>, and comes without any warranty, without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>Feature Summary</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Kernel-mode digital signature verification for ELF executables and dynamic libraries</li>
	<li>Uses SHA-1 digest and RSA encryption, with key length of 1024 or 2048 bits <em>(to be improved, see below)</em></li>
	<li>Signature validation caching, to bring performance impact down to a negligible amount</li>
	<li>Signature revocation</li>
	<li>Implemented as a Linux Security Module, currently supporting kernel version 3.12</li>
</ul>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Support for 4096-bit RSA keys (and RSA keys of arbitrary length)</li>
	<li>Support for signature verification using elliptic curve cryptography (ECDSA)</li>
	<li>SHA-256 and SHA-512 (and eventually SHA-3) digest algorithm</li>
	<li><code>dsngctl</code> tool for user tuning of module parameters</li>
	<li><code>dsngsign</code> tool for digitally signing ELF binaries</li>
	<li>Ability to stack with other kernel security modules</li>
	<li>Support for other kernel releases (particularly, support for every LTS kernel release, plus the latest kernel release)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Develop</h2>
<p>Development of the DigSig-ng project is conducted using git for revision control, with repositories currently hosted on GitHub. You can check out the kernel sources at <code>https://github.com/digsig-ng/linux-digsig.git</code>. The DigSig-ng source code lives within the <code>security/digsig</code> directory of the source tree.</p>

<h2>Contribute</h2>
<p>There are a few ways the project could be improved. If you're interested in contributing and you'd like some guidance, send an e-mail to the address in the contact section of this page.</p>

<h2>Breaking Issues</h2>
<p>There are some known issues which are currently being worked on. These issues include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Attempting to compile while CONFIG_LIBMPI is enabled will fail due to a conflict between the module's gnupg version and the gnupg MPI library present in the Linux kernel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>There is currently no documentation available as part of the DigSig-ng project, however, the documentation on the DigSig/DSI website is still applicable.</p>

<h2>Downloads</h2>
<h3>Current Release</h3>
<p>There is currently <b>no stable release</b> of DigSig-ng. If you're feeling adventurous, you can download the code from Git and build it yourself.</p>
<h3>Other Downloads</h3>
<p>You can find documents of historical interest <a href="files/historical">in the downloads folder of this server</a>.</p>
